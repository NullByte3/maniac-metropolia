# Market kassa aika

We could easily get the data for how long a worker takes to serve a single customer in a market as we could gather the data easily,
and we could see when is high traffic time, when is not, this should be really really easy if we just have the data, time, day of week, etc.

This should be easier to do in code or math, instead of randomly testing in the real world.
