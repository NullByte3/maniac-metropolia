(task 1)
We could collect some metrics for a hospital, and we could gather arrived clients (A), serviced (C), active service time (B) and the total time for everyone which was (T), we could utilize these to basically, improve, like if we need more doctors, or whatever, depending on the metrics.

(task 2)
We could just update the metrics at all service points, by having the client hold a number, like we do in like, hospital queues (there's a screen that gives you a number), and yeah.

(task 3)
SKIP, I'm lazy.

(task 4)
customers = []
while (true):
   handle new arrivals (A)
   check if we have a empty service point, if so, continue, else, return.
   serve a customer from the array, the first customer, update his metrics (by his number) (C & B)
   continue the loop, update the time. (T)
